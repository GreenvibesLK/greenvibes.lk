Candidates who are employed are typically more attractive to employers. However, it can be a dangerous move and could end in a disaster.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere are some job search tips to help you stay on good terms with your current employer:&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DO plan your job search:&nbsp;</strong>Because you have a job, your time is limited, so you must organize your search, explore your options and get your resume and cover letter customized for each job you want to apply for. Try not to neglect your current tasks so you don&rsquo;t ruin your reputation right before you quit.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DO job interviews on your own time:</strong>&nbsp;Try to schedule your interviews out of your working hours or during lunch breaks to keep your absence to a minimum.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DO dress appropriately:</strong>&nbsp;If your normal work attire is not appropriate for interviews, then you need to bring a change of clothes and change elsewhere before you head out to the interview and back to work.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DO give adequate notice:</strong>&nbsp;When it&rsquo;s time to leave, resign officially in writing, give your &ldquo;one month&rdquo; notice and make the transition as smooth as possible. It&rsquo;s been said that you can judge the true character of an employee by the way they leave a job.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DON&rsquo;T tell your boss:</strong>&nbsp;As soon as your boss knows you&rsquo;re looking, you will be viewed as a short-timer and you might be treated differently, so try not to inform your employer that you&rsquo;re job-searching until you have accepted another offer.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DON&rsquo;T tell your colleagues either:</strong>&nbsp;If you want to discuss your job search, talk to friends and family, because as soon as one colleague knows, you might as well assume that everyone does - including your boss, and if your boss hears about it from someone before you&rsquo;ve formally met with him/her, it will reflect negatively on you.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DON&rsquo;T job search on company time:</strong>&nbsp;This is like stealing money from your employer, since they are paying you for this time. Do your research during &ldquo;off&rdquo; hours from your personal computer and make your phone calls from your personal cell phone during breaks.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DON&rsquo;T use company resources:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Resources&rdquo; include your email, internet, computer, fax machine, telephone, copier, and any other company supplies. Not only is it unethical, but you also risk ruining your reputation on your final days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DON&rsquo;T change your current attitude at work:</strong>&nbsp;Keep it professional at your current job and make sure you&rsquo;re still a committed member of the team. Leaving on good terms is essential if you&rsquo;re going to need referrals and recommendations in the future, so make sure you don&rsquo;t burn any bridges!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-11-10', 1, '2013-11-10', 1, NULL, NULL, 0),

Candidates need to craft a different message, focusing on how they can benefit the company by saving them money, streamlining processes, creating additional sources of income and bringing overall value to the company. Since no career article can fully prepare you in the right way for how employers really think, you need to come up with creative ways on how you fit in the specific position and company for which you are applying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Demonstrating Your Fit on Paper</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If definitely takes more effort to customize your CV for each vacancy but it&#39;s worth the time, especially when applying for jobs that require certain skills and experience. Don&#39;t bother elaborating on your personality traits on paper, but instead give examples of what you have done and can do to grab the employer&rsquo;s attention. Employers are looking for key character traits that can be demonstrated in the interview. They want to make sure you are going to be able to do the job and fit into their specific corporate culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>what you have done and can do to grab the employer&rsquo;s attention. Employers are looking for key character traits that can be demonstrated in the interview. They want to make sure you are going to be able to do the job and fit into their specific corporate culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Keeping Your Focus on the Job &ndash; It&rsquo;s Not All About You</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mainly job seekers start off their job search on the wrong note by making it all about them. It is actually a misconception as you need to sell what the employer is buying. When responding to the statement, &ldquo;Tell me about yourself&rdquo;, you need to give a personal response that is relevant to what drives the company, what their priorities are now and in the future, and what skills they value. Most importantly, find out what problems they have that need to be solved and talk about how your personal skills can contribute to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Your Attitude is Everything</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to interviews, ask yourself a fundamental question: What attitude did you bring into this meeting? People generally don&rsquo;t have a high level of attitude awareness, but that&rsquo;s what you need to master in order to make a great impression. Most interviewers won&rsquo;t even give a second thought to someone who has a negative presence or seems like they almost need to be talked into the job. Remember that you&rsquo;re selling yourself, and part of you is the positive approach that you&rsquo;ll bring into the office with you every morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be More Than One Dimensional</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever noticed who gets ahead at work? Often, it&rsquo;s the IT guy with the strong business sense, the engineer with the exceptional leadership abilities, or the sales person with an understanding of how to manage a team. Those employees are more than one dimensional. They are uncommon individuals who prefer to stand out from the common crowd. They constantly search for their competitive advantage and devote their time and attention to mastering valuable skills and knowledge that is usually discovered by travelling in the opposite direction to the masses. By developing a combination of skills sets that are in high demand and less common in the job market you&rsquo;ll create a competitive edge for yourself that will allow you to take on better opportunities over your career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-11-12', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

From &nbsp;having a well written CV tailored to the job, to preparing answers to common interview questions ahead of time; these are all tip that have become common knowledge to almost all job seekers. But are there any job interview tips that job seekers might not be aware of?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Read The Things That Your Interviewers Read</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you get the call you&rsquo;ve been waiting for from a potential employer, you immediately get on your laptop and start researching the company and the job description. That&rsquo;s all great, but have you ever considered reading articles that are directed towards the interviewers on the other side of the table? That would be interesting wouldn&rsquo;t it? By reading articles that are directed towards interviewers, you can get a lot of insight into what they are trained to look for in a candidate and why they might ask certain questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Role Play With A Friend But With You Playing The Role Of Interviewer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When talking to experienced hiring managers who have interviewed many candidates in the past, they will often say that they don&rsquo;t get nervous at their own job interviews anymore. Why? It&rsquo;s because they were at the other side of the table so many times that they understand how an interviewers&rsquo; mind works. You can get a taste of this advantage by playing the interviewer yourself. Get a friend, suggest that you practice together but that you play the interviewer this time. You might be surprised by how much more comfortable it will make you feel when it comes to the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Research The Person You&rsquo;ll Be Meeting With</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is totally acceptable to ask about the name of the person who will interview you. By finding out ahead of time, you won&rsquo;t be taken by surprise if you walk into the interview expecting to meet with one person and then find out that it&rsquo;s actually going to be a panel interview in front of five people. Research your interviewers ahead of time to try and get a feel of how the interview will go.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Don&rsquo;t Walk In Too Early</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You have probably heard people saying that you should arrive to job interviews early. But what about showing up too early? Most interviewers get annoyed when candidates show up more than ten minutes early. This might make them feel obligated to stop what they&rsquo;re doing in order to come out and greet you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>After The Interview</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re done with the interview, just put the job and the interview out of your mind. Many job seekers drive themselves crazy wondering how the interview went, second guessing their answers and trying to predict when they&rsquo;ll hear back from the employer. Try to get it out of your system and move on mentally. Follow up if you haven&rsquo;t heard back from the company in two weeks but, until then, don&rsquo;t dwell on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.akhtaboot.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">www.akhtaboot.com</a></em></p>\r\n', '2013-11-19', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

Many young job seekers make similar mistakes while trying to manage their careers as they don&rsquo;t seem to know what they really want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you learn how to properly manage your career early on in your life; the results may astonish you. Akhtaboot highlights the common mistakes employees make in their twentites and how to overcome them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Starting Your Job Search Too Late</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh graduates who assume that they will get a job without too much effort often wait too long to begin the process. Ideally, university students should start looking for meaningful internships for the summer before they graduate. The best internships to get early on are with companies that have wide brand recognition; having big company names on your CV will open doors for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Choosing to Work at a Company for All The Wrong Reasons</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many employees in their early twenties prefer to choose to work at companies that offer the most flexibility in terms of time, free food, entertainment rooms and team outings. Those are all nice benefits, but not as much as the character of your direct manager. Great leaders will invest in you. Keep in mind that working for someone that demands excellence and purchases your limits everyday will build the most solid foundation for your ongoing career advancement. If you&rsquo;re getting something from the job that will help you succeed, stay until you have enough of that, and then leave. Use it to get the next job with the better boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Staying Too Long in a Field That is Not Right For You</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates in their early twenties tend to think that once they land their first job, they are stuck there for at least a year for fear of employment gaps showing in their CV. When starting a job early on your career, you should be building it around a field that you really want to pursue. But once you realize you are not in the right place, figure out how to get out of it as soon as possible. Don&rsquo;t worry so much about lost time, because employers are willing to take risks on you while you are still young and fresh. But by the time you reach your thirties employers start to look sideways at employee who are still searching for what they want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Thinking You are Entitled</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major misconception that is popular among younger employees is the attitude of entitlement. You have to earn what you get. This obvious fact is often overlooked by the many young job seekers. They think employers should hire them because of their award winning personality. You have got to have a little something to show for yourself in order to stand out from the crowd so that you are potential employer will actually listen to what you have to say. A great CV is the best place to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Your Twenties are Not Practice Time</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take your life seriously enough to do things in your twenties that will last into your thirties. Focus on using a systematic way to try new jobs and new relationships to figure where you fit. Don&rsquo;t put off starting to build a career; the sooner you start out in an industry and role that you like, the sooner you can start growing into a long-term satisfying career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-11-28', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

Communication is definitely not only about the words you say; you can have an excellent vocabulary and still be a bad communicator. While some people are naturally gifted when it comes to communication, others need to work on it in order to be viewed as potential leaders and get promoted into top jobs. Even the best of us sometimes miscommunicate, miss the point, cause an unintentional reaction, or avoid a messy discussion altogether. Who hasn&rsquo;t left a discussion thinking that things went in the wrong direction? The good news is that it&rsquo;s a universal struggle. Akhtaboot reveals some of the common communication mistakes at the workplace and what you can to avoid them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake # 1 &ndash; Not Editing Your Work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to written communication, spelling and grammar mistakes can make you look careless and unprofessional. That&rsquo;s why it is essential to check all of your work-related emails, messages or chats before you send them. Don&rsquo;t rely on spell checkers; they won&rsquo;t pick up words that are used incorrectly or phrases that don&rsquo;t make real sense. Instant, proofread your work more than once, use a dictionary if you are unsure of some words and you may even read your work outlawed as it makes it easier to catch typos and wrong sentences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake # 2 &ndash; Body Language Miscommunications</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us think that communication is mostly done through words or in written. This is not actually the case as body language, including your hand movements, eyes and facial expressions often says things louder than your mouth. Using body language inappropriately can send mixed signals to those who pick up these hints. An employee who does not understand body language, for example, may not notice a client&rsquo;s slightly raised eyebrows and wondering eyes during a meeting, which would cause him to miss the fact that the client is feeling uncomfortable, vary or distant. Another important move that you need to mind is that crossing your arms while someone is speaking can send signals that your mind is close to what they are saying, regardless of whether that is the case or not. Watch your body language to avoid misunderstandings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake # 3 &ndash; Avoiding Difficult Conversations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point in your career, you will need to give negative feedback or bad news to one of your peers, your subordinates or even your boss. It is surely tempting to avoid these conversations, but this might cause further problems if you decide to hide it. When it comes to such scenarios, preparation is important. Learn to give clear, actionable and constructive feedback to the person you are addressing without insulting them as a person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mistake # 4 &ndash; Not Keeping An Open Mind When Meeting New People</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s workplace is a mix of people from different ages, religions, ethnics and backgrounds. These differences create a rich environment of experience and opinions that greatly enhance your working life. However, it can sometimes be tempting to stereotype people unintentionally, or to make assumptions about them based on just a few pieces of information. Assumptions stand in the way of open communication, because you don&rsquo;t consider the other person&rsquo;s own unique background, personality and experience. Overtime, this can start to jeopardize your relationship with them. Learn to have an open mind, listen carefully, and give the person in front of you the space to talk and express their own opinions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-12-01', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

Some may try to do that, but it is almost impossible to do so. All top companies started with great employees onboard, and that&rsquo;s why every smart leader must find and hire the best people in order for their business to thrive. In today&rsquo;s workplace, finding the right candidates for your business has become a critical task and involves rigorous planning. Business owners can&rsquo;t afford to do a bad hiring as the cost of finding, interviewing, engaging and training new employees is high. Keep in mind that each new hire requires a desk, a computer, phone and other equipment, let alone salaries, benefits and taxes. Akhtaboot identifies the top personality traits that you should consider to find the best new employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Competency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being competent is all about having the necessary skills, experience and education to successfully complete the task you need performed. Some employers assume it&rsquo;s easy to fill junior positions, but finding skilled candidates with high potential is an entirely different matter. You need to make sure that they have a willingness and desire to learn and progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Problem Solving Skills</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to use initiative solve problems is one of the top ten skills you need to look for in potential candidates. You want people who will take the personal responsibility to make sure targets are met and who try to come with a better of doing something and who are prepared to research and commit to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cultural Fit</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since personal characteristics are usually not the part of the job description, when it comes to finding the right candidates, the deciding factor may actually be &ldquo;cultural fit&rdquo;. This means that your hire should be able to get along with you and his other colleagues. A critical component to also consider is the person&rsquo;s willingness and ability to harmonious with you. If the candidates can&rsquo;t do that, there will be problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Commitment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you hire someone, you need to make sure that the candidate is serious about working for the long term as you don&rsquo;t want to hire someone who&rsquo;s just wasting time until they find something better. Talk about the candidate&rsquo;s job history and the time spent at each position in order to get clear insight on the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Character</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal characteristics are the biggest predictor of whether a potential candidate will succeed, even over skills and knowledge. But how do you evaluate that? Simply interviewing them isn&rsquo;t enough. We are talking about traits such as ethics, integrity and values. You don&rsquo;t have to rely only on your gut instincts. Reference checks can be tremendously helpful when evaluating personal characteristics. In addition, taking a closer look at the candidate&rsquo;s CV can reveal if the candidate has proactively steered his career in a way that signals growth and not opportunism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Compensation Fit</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not smart to offer a compensation that is much lower than the market. Even if the person you hire is satisfied with what is offered, eventually they&rsquo;ll figure out their real value and start looking for jobs elsewhere as they may start to feel unappreciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-12-11', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

Well, it turns out that while technical competency is crucial to your professional success, it&rsquo;s highly essential that you also have great people skills or what is called &ldquo;likeability&rdquo;. People skills are described as your ability to monitor thoughts and speech, empathize with others and build relationships of trust and respect in your daily interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While having a &ldquo;likable&rdquo; personality depends on the nature of your character, you can work on your people skills to enjoy better relationships at work. Akhtaboot highlights the top people skills that will help you create satisfying and productive interaction in the workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Ability to Relate to Others</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the top factors of a success in a future job is your ability to relate to others and their personal viewpoints. It simply means that you are willing to agree or disagree with mutual respects; letting them know you understand their position. If you have this ability, you are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore will also have a wide network of communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Ability to Trust Others</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t speedup your career if you aren&rsquo;t able to depend on and put your trust in other people. Without trust, you can&rsquo;t get projects done or get others to cooperate. Mistrust cultivates doubt, low productivity, lost sales, and high turnover. Keep in mind that it takes time to build and it also requires effort and diligence to maintain</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Ability to Show Empathy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having the ability to place yourself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes is a key people skill. It allows us to build meaningful relationships with others, provides insight into what others maybe feeling or thinking and how or why others are reacting to situations. In brief, it sharpens your &ldquo;people intelligence&rdquo; and it backs up our decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Expressing Genuine Interest in Others</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People can sense if you are genuinely interested in them. Showing interest in someone&rsquo;s ability, background, stories, hobbies, career, family, or anything else makes that person feel connected to you. Make your greeting standout, remember people&rsquo;s names and listen with interest in order to give them a sense of importance, well-being an value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Active Listening Skills</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing someone talk and actively listening to them are two different things. During discussions, most people tend to phase out and start to form a response in their mind and interrupt the flow before they finish what they are saying. The key is to actively listen, which takes more time but produces better outcomes. Allow others to vent and then take the time to form a response. It sure needs some practice, but it pays off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A Great Sense for Humor</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have tendency to sometimes take ourselves way too seriously at work. However, injecting some well-placed, light humor into a business situation can enhance your career and also your likability. Humor creates a cheerful atmosphere that encourages interaction and brain-storming of new ideas. In general, funny people are usually easy to approach, so the more approachable you are, especially as a leader, the more authentic and open people around you will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-12-15', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

Leadership styles have evolved overtime, with a clear shift from the bureaucratic and directive leadership style of the twentieth century to a more autonomous approach. Lines are becoming more and more blurred between person and professional goals. The new leadership paradigm works through emotions. When leaders drive emotions positively, they bring out everyone&rsquo;s best. The truth of the matter is that many business too this day still struggle with defining leadership at every level. Far too many people in managerial positions remain unwilling or unable to make the changes necessary to create a healthy, thriving enterprise capable of enduring. It is time for change; Akhtaboot presents the traits of successful leaders of today so that an organisation can position itself favourably for future success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>They Invest In Their People</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many organisations hold back on Training &amp; Development programmes as they fear people might leave after they&rsquo;ve heavily invested in them. This might happen, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. However one of the main reasons why many people leave organisations is that they don&rsquo;t feel valued by their employers. Successful leaders don&rsquo;t just mouth empty phrases like &ldquo;people are our greatest assets&rdquo;, they demonstrate that by unlocking the untapped potential of their employees. They understand that by doing that they will gain an edge in recruiting and retaining top talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>They Free People from Boxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Micromanagement is the paradigm of all, obsolete leadership style, the new paradigm frees people from boxes. It&rsquo;s all about helping people reach places they didn&rsquo;t know they could go. They understand that if they try to control everything employs do, they will end up feeling patronised and will begin to resent their jobs. The new leader will need to balance the roles of Boss, mediator and mentor allowing teams more freedom and autonomy while keeping them focussed on objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>They Practice Transparency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to build trust with your employees is to be clear about what you are and aren&rsquo;t doing. Transparent leadership is a way of thinking and behaving everyday with every action, reaction and transaction. Fore transparent leadership to be effective, leaders must be humble, open, honest and straightforward. Transparent leadership is about engaging the passion of your employees and allowing them to generate ideas to help your business thrive. This also means that you should always give credit where when it is due.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Better Communication Leads to Better Results</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For leaders to succeed in today&rsquo;s business world they need to be great communicators. This is especially true when it comes to communicating performance expectations. They shouldn&rsquo;t assume and everyone knows as much as about the subject as they do; instead, they need to take the time to listen, explain and give a brief background on the subject at hand. Great leaders create an open environment that allows them to share their candid opinions freely. They show compassion and humility to make people feel heard. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that employees will like everything you have to say, but they will respect you and perform where you communicate early and often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2013-12-21', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

It is frustrating as it makes them wonder if their application was actually seen or if they did not make the cut. While some employers will occasionally give rejected candidates some feedback about where they need to improve or what went wrong, the majority of employers hold back on telling candidates why they were rejected. Whatever might be the reason for being rejected, you need to be prepared to increase your chances of getting the job. You can start by awarding the top job seeker behaviours employers hate. Akhtaboot reveals to top reasons employers will not share why they did not hire you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>You Exaggerate Your Qualifications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It should always be noted that employers look for honesty in candidates. But many job seekers believe that there is no room for modesty when it comes to job searching. From exaggerating on your CV to never admitting even one weakness during the interview, any false information will be noticeable, as you might not be able to support the information you have presented. Employers will always prefer people who are open, honest and speak straight face-to-face.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>You Are Overqualified For The Position</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving the impression that you have more experience than the job requires will give the impression that you do not really understand what the job is all about. Hiring Managers will also assume that your salary expectations are probably higher than the role pays and they will disregard your application. The best thing that you can do in this situation is to understand these valid concerns and address them early on. Start by explaining why you are genuinely interested in the position and make it clear that you are fine with the lower pay that comes with the position.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>We Don&rsquo;t Like You</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since personal characteristics are usually not part of the job description, when it comes down to finding the right candidate, the deciding factor may actually be &ldquo;likeability&rdquo;. No one wants to work with arrogant, negative, troublemakers who will not be able to get along with their colleagues. This is all about your ability to get along with your colleagues. You need to show the willingness and the ability to be harmonious with others; if you cannot do that, do not expect a callback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>You Did Not Make A Great First Impression</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We often hear that first impressions matter. It actually could be the differentiating factor between you getting the job or not. During the interview, judgments are being made on both your appearance and behavious. From the way you shake hands to the way you smell, or the way you are dressed to the way you talk. This sounds obvious but you would be surprise how often people get it wrong. Depending on where you are interviewing, make sure that you come across as the perfect fit for the role. Make sure that you know how casual the company that you are interviewing at is; looking far too formal or under dressed for the company might give a negative vibe about your candidacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2014-01-15', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

Employees just want the truth more than ever and they need their leaders to have their backs. If this is so, why is it that so many organizations struggle to achieve and maintain trust, yet fail to achieve commitment from their staff? Sadly, throughout the world, many people have real trust issues with their management, but what are the warning signs? Akhtaboot lists the warning signs of low trust to lookout for in an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Avoiding Contradict</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many employees chose not to standup for what they believe in and try to avoid conflict at all costs. They prepare not to voice their opinions as they are afraid to fail. These are all signs of lack of trust. Employees who try to avoid conflict hesitate to ask for help or to provide constructive feedback. This creates an environment where back-channel politics and personal attacks thrive. Another enemy of trust is selective communication. These occurs when only information that makes employees look good is communicated while &ldquo;bad news&rdquo; is delayed or avoided all together. When employees the courage to try to unleash their full potential that of others, it often becomes an challenge to trust their judgment and overall capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Hoarding Information</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An evident sign of having trust issues is when employees act secretive, territorial, and cautious around other team members. Information hoarding can be a result of personal insecurity or from past delaying with unethical or discriminatory management. It should be a leader&rsquo;s top priority to make commination a commitment for each team member and assess them on this as a part of the annual review. Make sure that the team is recognized for collaborative results and not just individual achievements and ensure that all members know that team success is their priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>High Turnover</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Turnover is a major issue impacting the performance and profitability to many companies and it is a result of lack of trust. Organizations are increasingly taking proactive steps to build high trust cultures because it helps improve turnover rates. By extending trust to their employees, leaders can demonstrate their willingness to support them, which eventually leads to lower turnover rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Job Burnout</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lack of trust leads to job burnout, exhaustion, depersonalization and feelings of being ineffective at work. If leaders do not strive to change that by creating a positive culture that energizes people, there will be consequences. To improve your employees&rsquo; moral you need to get inside their heads. Make transparency the norm; the more you communicate, the more you foster trust and the more loyalty built. Host frequent town hall meetings in which you listen to employees&rsquo; fears, concerns and ideas and share your vision for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Listen</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for employees to trust their company, they expect management to deliver on their promises and to be honest and open in all communications. If you fail to do that, they will stop listening to you. Be clear in letting employees know what you expect from them, and what they can expect of you in return. Put new policies in writing, and if you are changing standard operating procedures, be specific when you tell employees what the changes mean. Ask for input to show you are listening to their needs, which will set the stage for insisting they listen to you as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2014-01-29', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

New projects and technology improvements are forcing companies to introduce ongoing changes to the way we work in order to stay ahead of the competition. Change can be intimidating and challenging even to the best of us. However, in to day&rsquo;s workplace, your adaptability to change is what keeps you significant and relevant.&nbsp; Any major transformation takes us out of our comfort zones and creates people issues and insecurities. A leader&rsquo;s role when it comes to introducing change can never be underestimated. They need to learn as much as you about the impending change and help their employees better understand the rationale behind it. For change to happen, it helps if the whole company supports it. Akhtaboot presents the steps to lead and implement change successfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Recognize the Need for Change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Employees are not so much against change as they are against being changed. If you leave too much to the employee&rsquo;s imagination when it comes to change, that can create unnecessary misrepresentations and make change management difficult. Change should address a specific problem that employees are aware of so they can do what is necessary to fix it. This involves identifying problems the company faces, assigning a level of importance to each one, and assessing the kinds of changes needed to solve the problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Gain Unified Agreement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For change to be implemented successfully, all concerned parties need to get involved to create enthusiasm and a sense of ownership among employees. You&nbsp; can also ask for the input of those who are not directly involved in the change as their support for the new plan can help employees feel more at ease. When the management team shows unified support for a newly introduced initiative, it is easier for employees to follow through with implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Introduce Change in Phases</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not go live with the change immediately. Place a structure for change, and continually check for obstacles and barriers. Addressing&nbsp; obstacles early on can empower the people you need to execute your vision, and it can help the change move forward. Have a small group of employees try the change first to identify any errors or alterations that need to be made. Once you do that, slowly integrate the change into your organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Monitor the Progress and Seek Feedback</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be open for feedback and listen to any concerns your people may have. While some may not agree with certain changes simply because they were in the habit of doing things the old way, others may have smart and alternative solutions that you should consider. Implement employee-based feedback that seems valid so you can make the transition go more smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Incorporate the Change into the Company Culture</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your corporate culture often determines what gets done and what does not, so in order for any change to stick, it should be incorporated into the core of your company culture. Make continuous efforts to ensure that the change is seen in every aspect of your employees&rsquo; daily work. Talk about progress during weekly meetings and performance reviews. Tell success stories about the change process. It is also important that all of your company&rsquo;s leaders continue to support the change every step of the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Akhthaboot - the career network</em></p>\r\n', '2014-02-15', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0),

That&rsquo;s why many managers tend to take a reactive approach to handling employee mistakes. They have been taught how to give feedback and deal with conflict through corrective actions such as verbal or written warnings, and sometimes, termination. As a result, they often perceive handling employee mistakes as a confrontational situation and an inevitable part of being a manager. But this shouldn&rsquo;t always be the case as most mistakes can be avoided if the right precautions are taken in advance. Akthaboot offers several tips to help you limit employee errors in your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Set Clear Expectations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting expectations is one of the basic fundamentals of leadership; yet, many managers fail to make clear requests that have no room for interpretation. The first step towards setting clear expectations is planning. The more time you dedicate to planning, the more effective your team will be when they start executing. The second component of setting clear expectations requires great communication skills. Your employees want to be on the same page as you, they want to make smart decisions, but they cannot read minds. Rephrase your requests in a way that can be heard, often several times, before they become internalized by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Document Your Expectations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Making clear requests is a great start when it comes to limiting employee mistakes, but over time people tend to forget what was agreed upon and you can still fall into the &ldquo;I said, he said&rdquo; trap. If you feel that your request can be misinterpreted from what you intended, make sure that you document it in writing or using electronic systems. There are many systems that allow you to assign tasks to employees while allowing them to ask questions, give updates, and request more information. It also gives you a point of reference if there is a problem later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Address Any Problems with Facts</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mistakes happen to the best employees and systems. Whether intentional or due to negligence. When the time to address mistakes with your team comes, you need to focus the team&rsquo;s&nbsp; attention on facts instead of feelings or personal issues. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to eliminate any emotional charge out of the conversation; you need to tackle the mistake in a factual approach by referring back to the initial request and the documentation. By doing so, you will be able to pinpoint team members who didn&rsquo;t follow the brief from those who simply misunderstood the request.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Document the Mistakes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart companies know the difference between a lesson learned and finding a permanent solution for it. Learning a lesson from mistakes happens only when we take responsibility for the mistake, try different approaches to achieve different results, and then integrate best practices into the company&rsquo;s culture by documenting all cases. Create some type of knowledge management system, which could be as a simple as a spreadsheet. This sheet will allow you to document the mistakes, the causes and the solutions, and then you can create some type of standard operating procedures. Once you share it with your employees, make sure that you periodically refer to it to ensure that the lesson has truly been learned and similar mistakes are less likely to be repeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By akthaboot - the career network</em></p>\r\n', '2014-02-18', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0);

But there is an answer. This question is an invitation to open up and see where it goes without worrying about saying the right things. If the candidate plays along and shows his human side, it can reveal a lot about his character, creativity, and likability. Since personal characteristics are usually not part of the job description, the deciding factor may actually be &quot;likability&quot;. No one wants to work with an arrogant, negative person who won&#39;t be able to get along with their colleagues. This question will help you discover the candidate&rsquo;s willingness to be harmonious with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Develop a strong Employee Value Proposition (EVP)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Employee Value Proposition is what makes your company attractive to work with and how you are different than other organisations. It&#39;s a combination of the benefits package, culture, opportunities for growth, and company values. Developing a solid EVP that incorporates what is important to the organisation with what is of value to its employees is the key to attracting the best people. Many world class companies are as famous for the way they treat their employees and the quality of their people as they are for their products and services. This is when an EVP works so well; people start queuing up to work for you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Simplify your job application system</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many employers to this day still use daunting and time consuming application systems. You need to make it easier for your candidate to follow through. Make sure that your application system is easy to use. Intuitive and capable of handling the applications.willingness to be harmonious with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that a company is only as good as its people, so if you want to build and maintain a successful business, you need to attract and hire the best candidates. Many employers mistakenly believe that it is very easy to find great job candidates in today&#39;s job market, but that&#39;s not the case. Top candidates know their worth and they understand the value that they can bring to your company. That&#39;s why they tend to be picky about what jobs they want to apply to, and the offers they accept. So if you truly care about attracting top talent, you need to put more thought into the way you attract and screen candidates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be honest about the salary</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since you&#39;re competing for the best candiates with other organisations, you need to offer a realistic salary. There&#39;s no need to play games. You need to show that you&#39;re investing in the candidate, if you want their investment in return. Many employers think that salary negotiation is the candidate&#39;s responsibility when in fact; you are the one offering the job. It&#39;s up to you to do the research and know the market value of the employee you are looking to hire. Shying away from openly discussing what the position pays will turn off good candidates. Talking about salary in the job description or at least in an early stage will attract strong candidates who will appreciate your company&#39;s openness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By akthaboot - the career network</em></p>\r\n', '2014-11-27', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0);
